## Emergency Protocols & Crisis Response

This section covers procedures for handling severe emergencies (arrest, physical threat, etc.).

### Detecting Imminent Emergency

**Warning Signs:**
```
Law Enforcement Contact:
- Police appear at your location
- Government agents approach you
- Authorities call or email
- Unexpected legal notice
- Warrant is served

Physical Threat:
- Unknown person follows you
- Vehicle tracks your movements
- Someone breaks into your location
- Threats or harassment
- Weapons or violence

Network Emergency:
- Internet cut off suddenly
- Multiple outages in sequence
- Deliberate network blocking (evidence of targeted action)
- Unusual network traffic or scanning

Contact Emergency:
- Contact arrested (related to your work)
- Multiple contacts arrested or go silent
- News reveals investigation touching your work
- Contact sends "distress signal" (pre-arranged code)
```

### Immediate Response (Arrest)

**If Arrested or Detained:**
```
FIRST PRIORITY: Physical Safety & Legal Protection
===================================================

1. DO NOT RESIST
   - Comply with physical commands (hands visible, etc.)
   - Don't run or fight
   - Resistance will be used against you legally
   - Physical safety is priority

2. INVOKE RIGHT TO COUNSEL
   - CLEARLY state: "I want to speak to a lawyer"
   - Repeat if asked questions
   - Do NOT answer questions without lawyer present
   - This is your RIGHT (provided by law)

3. DO NOT CONSENT TO SEARCHES
   - Say: "I do not consent to any searches"
   - Authoritieswill search anyway (if they have warrant)
   - Not consenting preserves legal options
   - Don't try to hide or destroy evidence (makes it worse)

4. DO NOT DISCUSS:
   - Your activities
   - Your contacts
   - Your motivations
   - Anything about communications
   - Remain silent (5th Amendment right)

5. REQUEST CONTACT WITH:
   - Lawyer (primary)
   - Emergency contact (secondary, if possible)
   - Medical attention (if needed)

Legal Rights (in US; varies by jurisdiction):
- Right to remain silent (don't talk)
- Right to have lawyer present (insist on this)
- Right to refuse consent to search (they may search anyway with warrant)
- Right to reasonable bail/release
```

### Device Handling During Arrest

**If Computer/Phone is Seized:**
```
DO:
✓ Allow seizure without resistance
✓ Accept receipt/documentation of seized items
✓ Remember serial numbers (if possible, visually)
✓ Tell lawyer about seizure
✓ Request list of seized items

DON'T:
✗ Attempt to delete files (obstruction of justice)
✗ Resist seizure (assault on officer)
✗ Destroy device (destruction of evidence)
✗ Hide device (concealing evidence)

Important: Encryption provides legal defense
- If computer is encrypted, authorities cannot access data
- This is legal right (privacy/5th Amendment)
- Refusal to provide password is protected (in many jurisdictions)
- Note: Some jurisdictions may compel password under certain circumstances
  (Consult lawyer for jurisdiction-specific laws)
```

### Post-Arrest Procedures

**After Arrest, Following Release or Legal Consultation:**
```
Step 1: Assess Situation
- What charges are you facing?
- What evidence do authorities have?
- Who else may be implicated?
- What level of compromise occurred?

Step 2: Legal Response (With Lawyer)
- Develop defense strategy
- Plan legal challenges
- Assess plea deal options (if offered)
- Protect other contacts/identities

Step 3: Operational Assessment
- Are other identities compromised?
- Are other contacts exposed?
- Should you abandon all operations?
- What containment is needed?

Step 4: Contact Notification (Carefully)
- Assume communications are monitored
- Use pre-arranged signal (if available)
- Don't disclose details
- Signal to other contacts: "Be careful"
```

### Physical Threat Response

**If Facing Physical Threat:**
```
Immediate (Life-Threatening Situation):
1. GET TO SAFETY FIRST
   - Leave location if possible
   - Go to crowded public area
   - Go to police station (if safe)
   - Call emergency services (911 in US)

2. PROTECT YOURSELF
   - Self-defense if necessary (within legal limits)
   - Assume threat is serious
   - Don't attempt to negotiate

3. REPORT TO AUTHORITIES
   - File police report
   - Document threats/incidents
   - Provide documentation to lawyer

Post-Threat Response:
1. Assess Level of Threat
   - Was threat credible?
   - What is current threat level?
   - Should you relocate?

2. Increase Physical Security
   - Install locks/cameras (if at own location)
   - Vary routine/schedule
   - Inform trusted people of situation
   - Prepare evacuation plan (if necessary)

3. Cease Operations (If Necessary)
   - Threat to life overrides operational goals
   - Pause or abandon operations
   - Focus on survival/safety
```

### Network Compromise Emergency

**If Internet is Cut/Controlled:**
```
Scenario: Internet is unexpectedly down, or you suspect monitoring/blocking

Immediate Assessment:
1. Is it widespread (ISP outage)?
2. Is it targeted (your connection only)?
3. How long has it been down?

Response Options:

Option A: Wait & Monitor (If Likely Outage)
- Most outages resolve in hours
- Resume when internet is restored
- No special action needed

Option B: Change Location (If Targeted)
- Move to different location with different ISP
- Use coffee shop, library, or other public WiFi
- Resume operations from new location
- Document ISP outage (for evidence)

Option C: Assume Seizure (If Authorities Are Involved)
- Cease operations on affected device
- Don't attempt to fix or diagnose
- Allow authorities to control situation
- Focus on legal defense
```

### Evacuation Procedures

**If You Must Abandon Your Location:**
```
Before Leaving (If Safe):
1. Secure YubiKey (take with you)
2. Secure recovery documents (if accessible)
3. Document what authorities may find
   (For lawyer to prepare defense)
4. Leave computer/devices (don't take; allows police to find/track you)

During Evacuation:
1. Travel light (minimal items)
2. Don't take anything identifiable
3. Use cash (not credit cards; traces spending)
4. Use public transportation (harder to track than personal vehicle)
5. Don't establish pattern (vary route/timing)

After Evacuation:
1. Go to safe location
   - Trusted friend/family
   - Hotel (pay cash)
   - Public area (library, park)
2. Contact lawyer
3. Assess threat level
4. Plan next steps
5. Do NOT maintain contact with previous identity
   (Could expose others)
```

### Pre-Emergency Planning

**Before Emergency Occurs, Plan:**
```
Document (Securely Stored):
1. Lawyer contact information
   - Name
   - Phone number
   - Office address
   - Email (if available)

2. Emergency contact (trusted person)
   - Name
   - Phone number
   - Code word/signal (what means "I'm in trouble")

3. Important dates
   - Identity key creation date
   - Master key expiration
   - Subkey rotation dates

4. Device inventory
   - Computer serial number
   - YubiKey serial number
   - Phone IMEI (if applicable)
   - Storage device serial numbers

5. Financi al information
   - Lawyer retainer information
   - Bail fund access
   - Trusted person to manage finances

6. Contingency Plans
   - If arrested: Use lawyer contact
   - If physical threat: Go to [location]
   - If forced to flee: Go to [backup location]
   - If identity compromised: Activate [procedure]

Storage:
- Memorize: Lawyer phone number, emergency contact
- Encrypted, offline: Other critical information
- In trusted person's possession: Backup copy of critical info
```

### Continuity of Operations

**If You're Incapacitated (Arrest, Hospitalization, etc.):**
```
Assumption: You cannot operate for extended period

Pre-Incident Planning:
1. Brief trusted contact on:
   - Nature of your work (general terms)
   - How long you might be unavailable
   - When to declare you "missing"
   - What to do if you don't return

2. Leave instructions (encrypted):
   - How to access fallback identity (if available)
   - How to notify other contacts
   - What data to preserve for defense
   - Lawyer contact for other people to reach out to

3. Establish check-in protocol:
   - Regular signal that you're safe
   - If signal stops: Contact assumes you're compromised
   - After X days of silence: Contact takes action

During Incapacitation:
- Operations are halted
- Contacts assume compromise
- Other identities are isolated
- Recovery plan awaits your release/recovery
```
