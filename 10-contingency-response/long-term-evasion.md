## Long-Term Evasion & On-the-Run Procedures

This section covers survival procedures if you must evade authorities for extended periods.

### When Evasion Becomes Necessary

**Triggering Events:**
```
Scenario 1: Warrant Issued
- Law enforcement has arrest warrant
- You cannot be arrested (operational reasons, safety concerns)
- You must avoid apprehension until circumstances change

Scenario 2: Active Persecution
- Government is actively pursuing you
- Your location is compromised
- You must relocate to evade capture

Scenario 3: Imminent Arrest Threat
- Credible evidence arrest is imminent
- You have intelligence of raid/arrest
- You must preemptively leave location

Scenario 4: Hostile Non-State Actors
- Criminal organization, corporate security, or extremist group
- Threatens your physical safety
- You must evade to ensure survival

Decision Point:
- Is evasion necessary? (legal options exhausted? death risk is real?)
- Can you turn yourself in safely? (lawyer, negotiation possible?)
- Or must you evade to survive?

Note: Evasion is extreme measure with serious consequences
- Becomes federal crime (fleeing justice)
- Makes future legal defense harder
- Restricts future life permanently
- Should be last resort only
```

### Immediate Evacuation (First 24 Hours)

**If You Must Leave Immediately:**
```
Hour 0-1: Decision & Preparation
1. Confirm necessity (not panic-driven)
   - Is threat real and immediate?
   - Are legal options exhausted?
   - Is this life-threatening?

2. Secure critical items
   - YubiKey (MOST CRITICAL - take with you)
   - Master key revocation certificate
   - Backup documents (encrypted, small)
   - Minimal cash (no credit cards)
   - Fake ID (if available, prepared in advance)
   - Phone (burner if possible)

3. Destroy operational data
   - Unmount encrypted volumes
   - If time permits: Securely delete critical files
   - If no time: Leave encrypted (authorities can't access)
   - Note: Don't destroy to extent it looks intentional
   - If emergency: Just leave and let encryption protect

4. Leave minimal trace
   - Close doors (don't leave obvious signs of evacuation)
   - Lights on (appear occupied)
   - Don't leave forwarding address
   - Don't send messages (can be traced)

Hour 1-6: Immediate Departure
1. Transportation
   - Walk first (avoid surveillance cameras from home)
   - Use public transportation (bus, train, not taxi/rideshare)
   - Use cash only (no credit card traces)
   - Go to random location (not predetermined safe house - may be watched)

2. Destination: Random Public Location
   - Airport, train station, hotel district
   - Crowded area (blend in)
   - Multiple exit routes
   - Far from home (minimum 50 miles)

3. Acquire Transportation
   - Bus/train ticket (cash payment)
   - Destination: City far enough away
   - Use bathroom on bus/train (change appearance)

Hour 6-24: Establish Safety
1. Acquire Shelter
   - Hotel: Pay cash, give fake name (standard practice)
   - Motel: Less likely to record identification
   - Hostel: May not require ID
   - Do NOT go to friend/family (compromises them, may be watched)

2. Acquire Supplies
   - Cash withdrawal: Use ATM in different area (last transaction)
   - Food: Convenience store (minimal surveillance)
   - Phone: Burner phone (cash purchase)
   - Clothes: Generic (different from what you were wearing)

3. Assess Situation
   - Check news for warrant/alert
   - Determine scope of pursuit
   - Decide: Evasion long-term or surrender soon?
   - Contact lawyer (burner phone, untraceable line)

4. Plan Next Steps
   - If domestic evasion: Plan relocation strategy
   - If international escape: Plan border crossing
   - If temporary: Plan surrender with lawyer
```

### Domestic Evasion (Staying in Country)

**Surviving Long-Term in Your Home Country:**
```
Challenge: Law enforcement actively seeking you

Principles:
1. Avoid patterns (no routine locations)
2. Minimize digital footprint (no credit cards, phone tracking)
3. Maintain plausibility (look like regular person, not fugitive)
4. Build support network (carefully, quietly)
5. Prepare for capture (always have lawyer's number)

Daily Operations:

Shelter (Housing):
- Option 1: Move frequently (motel every 3-5 days)
  * Cost: High (cash motels are expensive)
  * Security: Difficult to locate (no pattern)
  * Risk: Frequent moves attract attention

- Option 2: Trusted safe house
  * Cost: Free or low (depends on relationship)
  * Security: Known location (risk if safe house is under surveillance)
  * Risk: Harboring fugitive is federal crime (person helping you faces charges)

- Option 3: Remote location (rural hideout)
  * Cost: Variable
  * Security: Hard for authorities to search everywhere
  * Risk: Stand out as stranger in small community

Shelter Strategy:
- Rotate between multiple locations (3-4 safe houses if possible)
- Never stay more than 1-2 weeks in same place
- Pay in cash if not staying with trusted person
- Register under fake name (standard motel practice)
- Keep minimal possessions (portable, can evacuate quickly)

Identity Management:
- Use fake ID for day-to-day interactions
- Create alias with supporting documentation (difficult, requires resources)
- Avoid situations requiring ID verification
- Stay away from government buildings, airports, ID checks
- Assume law enforcement has your photo (avoid facial recognition locations)

Movement & Travel:
- Don't establish patterns
  * Don't always travel same route
  * Don't frequent same locations
  * Don't establish relationships with people
  * Don't spend extended time in same area

- Use public transportation (not personal vehicle)
  * Personal vehicle has plates (traceable)
  * No personal vehicle history

- Vary transportation methods
  * Bus one trip, train next trip, walk short distances
  * No pattern in travel method

- Avoid surveillance cameras
  * Don't walk past same camera repeatedly
  * Vary routes to avoid familiar locations
  * Assume all urban cameras are monitored

Financial Operations:
- Cash only (no credit cards, debit cards, checks)
- ATM withdrawals are tracked (minimize, space them out)
- No employment (paper trail)
- No income sources (except pre-prepared resources)
- Survive on savings/resources prepared before evasion

Pre-Evasion Preparation (Before You Need It):
- Accumulate cash (hidden, not in bank)
- Create fake ID (contacts, documents)
- Establish safe houses (trusted people willing to help)
- Arrange support (people who will help without questions)
- Document escape routes (roads, transportation)

Information Compartmentalization:
- Safe houses don't know about each other
- Support people don't know full picture
- No one person knows where you are
- Minimize communication (reduces traces)

Risk to Helpers:
- CRITICAL: Harboring fugitive is federal crime
- Anyone helping you faces serious legal consequences
- They could be charged with:
  * Harboring a fugitive (federal felony)
  * Accessory after the fact
  * Conspiracy
  * Sentence: Years in federal prison
- Be honest about risk: They're risking their freedom to help you
- Only ask if they truly understand and accept consequences
```

### Long-Term Sustainability

**If Evasion Must Continue for Months/Years:**
```
Psychological Challenges:
- Isolation (can't have normal relationships)
- Constant fear (may be captured anytime)
- Guilt (people helping you face legal consequences)
- Uncertainty (when will it end?)
- Identity loss (can't use real name, background)

Sustainability Strategies:

1. Establish Minimal Routine (But Vary It)
   - Need some consistency for mental health
   - But not predictable enough to locate
   - Example: Work as day laborer
     * Different job each day (no pattern)
     * Cash payment (no paperwork)
     * Physical work (keeps occupied mentally)
     * No background check required (use fake name)

2. Create False Identity
   - Name, birthday, background
   - Fictional work history
   - Fake social connections (if necessary)
   - Can hold minimal employment under false identity
   - Risk: Deep investigation reveals falsity

3. Maintain Mental Health
   - Isolation is primary danger to mental health
   - Limited social connection (if safe)
   - Regular communication with trusted contact (coded, infrequent)
   - Exercise (mental health, physical readiness)
   - Creative outlet (journaling, art, writing)
   - Do NOT turn to substance abuse (increases vulnerability)

4. Monitor Threat Level
   - How active is search?
   - Is threat increasing or decreasing?
   - When is best time to surrender?
   - Is there path to legal resolution?

5. Plan for Eventual Resolution
   - Long-term evasion is not sustainable forever
   - Eventually: Captured, negotiated surrender, or time passes (statute of limitations)
   - Have lawyer plan exit strategy (even if not immediately available)
   - Have contingency for capture (how to minimize damage)

6. Document Everything (Encrypted, Hidden)
   - Why you fled
   - Evidence of necessity (if justified)
   - Timeline of events
   - Any exonerating information
   - For future legal defense

Support Network During Evasion:
- Lawyer: Primary contact (confidential communication)
- One trusted person: Can know general location
- Safe house provider: Knows you're there (nothing more)
- Emergency contact: Only for dire emergency
- Everyone else: No contact (for their safety)

Cost of Long-Term Evasion:
- Financial: High (cash-only lifestyle, expenses)
- Psychological: Very high (isolation, stress)
- Social: Extreme (can't have normal relationships)
- Legal: Worsening (every day fugitive adds charges)
- Physical: Significant (stress on health)
- Relationships: Destroyed (can't contact family/friends)

Realistic Assessment:
- Can sustain 3-6 months (if well-resourced)
- 6-12 months becomes difficult (mental/physical strain)
- Beyond 1 year: Increasingly unsustainable
- Most fugitives are captured within 1-2 years

Alternative: Surrender
- Consult with lawyer
- Negotiate surrender terms
- Minimize charges/sentence
- Have legal defense ready
- Eventually: Face legal system
- May be better than indefinite evasion
```

### If Captured During Evasion

**Arrest While Evading:**
```
Upon Arrest:
1. Immediately invoke right to counsel
   - "I want to speak to a lawyer"
   - Repeat if questioned
   - Do NOT answer questions

2. Request lawyer contact
   - You've already arranged lawyer (prepared before evasion)
   - Provide lawyer's contact information
   - Authorities will contact them

3. Expect additional charges
   - Original charges still apply
   - NEW charges for evasion:
     * Fleeing to avoid prosecution (federal felony)
     * Harboring evidence of crime (possibly)
     * Obstruction of justice
   - Sentence will be significantly longer

4. Evidence handling
   - YubiKey will be seized
   - Encrypted drives will be secured
   - You likely won't recover devices
   - Assume law enforcement has physical access to equipment

5. Legal strategy (With Lawyer)
   - Address evasion charges (why you fled)
   - Self-defense? Justify necessity
   - Mental health crisis? Diminished capacity
   - Plan defense for original charges (now secondary)
   - Negotiate plea deal if possible
   - Prepare for trial

Post-Arrest Reality:
- You will likely serve significant prison time
- If charges are serious: Decades of incarceration
- Evasion added years to potential sentence
- Only legal defense path forward (no technical security now)
- Focus: Work with lawyer for best possible outcome
```
